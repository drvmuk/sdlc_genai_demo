This implementation provides a comprehensive Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipeline that meets all the technical requirements:

1. TR-DLT-001: The code loads customer and order data from CSV files into Delta tables, with proper error handling and data cleaning.
2. TR-DLT-002: It creates an ordersummary table by joining customer and order data.
3. TR-DLT-003: It implements SCD Type 2 logic to track changes in customer data over time.
4. TR-DLT-004: It creates a customeraggregatespend table with aggregated data.
5. TR-DLT-005: All of the above is implemented using Delta Live Tables (DLT).

The code includes:
- Proper error handling with logging
- Data validation and cleaning
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Documentation in the README
- Configuration management
- Production-quality code structure

The implementation is designed to be scalable for large datasets and follows Databricks best practices for DLT pipelines.
