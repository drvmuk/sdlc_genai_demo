	+ Main Flow / Functional Steps:
		- Remove null records from "customer" and "order" Delta tables
		- Remove duplicate records from "customer" and "order" Delta tables

* **FR-DLT-004: Create ordersummary Table and Load Joined Data**
	+ Title: Create ordersummary Table and Load Joined Data
	+ Description: The system must create "ordersummary" table if not exists and load joined data from "customer" and "order" Delta tables.
	+ Preconditions: 
		- "customer" and "order" Delta tables exist
		- "ordersummary" table does not exist or can be created
	+ Main Flow / Functional Steps:
		- Create "ordersummary" table if not exists in catalog="gen_ai_poc_databrickscoe" and schema="sdlc_wizard"
		- Join "customer" and "order" data using "CustId" field
		- Load joined data into "ordersummary" SCD type 2 table

* **FR-DLT-005: Implement SCD Type 2 Logic for ordersummary Table**
	+ Title: Implement SCD Type 2 Logic for ordersummary Table
	+ Description: The system must implement SCD type 2 logic for "ordersummary" table to maintain history and update records when there is a change in "customer" table.
	+ Preconditions: 
		- "ordersummary" table exists
		- "customer" table exists
	+ Main Flow / Functional Steps:
		- When there is a change in "customer" table, update "ordersummary" table by making old records inactive and new records active
		- Update StartDate and EndDate accordingly to maintain history

* **FR-DLT-006: Create customeraggregatespend Table and Load Aggregated Data**
	+ Title: Create customeraggregatespend Table and Load Aggregated Data
