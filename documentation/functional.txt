Here is the detailed Functional Requirement Document (FRD) based on the provided Business Requirement Document (BRD):

**FR-DTL-001: Load Customer and Order Data into Delta Tables**

* **Title:** Load Customer and Order Data into Delta Tables
* **Description:** The system must read source CSV data from a specified volume and load it into delta tables for customer and order data, perform data cleansing, and then create and load a summary table using SCD type 2.

* **Preconditions:**
	+ Source CSV files for customer and order data are available at the specified locations: `/Volumes/gen_ai_poc_databrickscoe/sdlc_wizard/customerdata` and `/Volumes/gen_ai_poc_databrickscoe/sdlc_wizard/orderdata`.
	+ The schema of the customer and order data is known: `CustId, Name, EmailId, Region` and `OrderId, ItemName, PricePerUnit, Qty, Date, CustId` respectively.

* **Main Flow / Functional Steps:**
	* Read source CSV data from the specified volume into delta tables for customer and order data.
	* Remove "Null"/Null and duplicate records from both customer and order tables.
	* Create the "ordersummary" table if it does not exist in the specified catalog (`gen_ai_poc_databrickscoe`) and schema (`sdlc_wizard`).
	* Join customer and order data using the "CustId" field and load the data into the "ordersummary" table using SCD type 2.
	* Implement logic to update the SCD type 2 "ordersummary" table whenever there is a change in the customer table, making old records inactive and new records active, and updating StartDate and EndDate accordingly.

**FR-DTL-002: Update SCD Type 2 Table on Customer Data Change**

* **Title:** Update SCD Type 2 Table on Customer Data Change
* **Description:** The system must update the SCD type 2 "ordersummary" table whenever there is a change in the customer table.

* **Preconditions:**
	+ The "ordersummary" table exists in the specified catalog (`gen_ai_poc_databrickscoe`) and schema (`sdlc_wizard`).
	+ The customer table has been updated.

* **Main Flow / Functional Steps:**
	* Detect changes in the customer table.
	* Update the "ordersummary" table by making old records inactive and new records active.
	* Update the StartDate and EndDate fields in the "ordersummary" table accordingly.

Note that FR-DTL-001 and FR-DTL-002 are related requirements, and FR-DTL-002 is a subset of the functionality described in FR-DTL-001. However, they are broken down into separate requirements for clarity and ease of implementation.
