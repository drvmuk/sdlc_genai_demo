	* Create catalog "bronzezone", schema "data", and tables "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" if they do not exist.
	* Ingest CSV data into "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" tables using DLT syntax and Auto Loader.
	* Create columns such as CreateDateTime, UpdateDateTime, and IsActive flag.
	* Update UpdateDateTime and IsActive flag when new data arrives.
7. **Alternate Flows / Exceptions**:
	* If CSV files are not found or are malformed, log an error and notify the Data Engineering Team.
	* If data ingestion fails, retry the process and log the error.
8. **Postconditions / Outputs**: Raw Customer and Order data is loaded into the Bronze layer.
9. **Business Rules**:
	* Use SCD type 2 to keep history.
	* Use watermark columns to track data changes.
10. **Data Requirements**:
	* Input: CSV files containing Customer and Order data.
	* Output: Loaded data in "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" tables.
11. **Assumptions**: Unity Catalog is properly configured and accessible.

13. **Priority**: High
14. **Acceptance Criteria**:
	* Data is correctly loaded into "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" tables.
	* CreateDateTime, UpdateDateTime, and IsActive flag are correctly populated.

**FR-ETL-002: Load Data to Silver Layer**

1. **Title**: Load Data to Silver Layer
2. **Description**: The system must load data from Bronze layer tables "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" into the Silver layer using DLT syntax and Auto Loader, applying data cleansing and SCD type 2 logic.
3. **Actor(s)**: Data Engineering Team, Unity Catalog
4. **Preconditions**: 
	* Data is loaded into "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" tables.
	* Unity Catalog is properly configured.
5. **Trigger**: Manual trigger or scheduled trigger to initiate the data load process.
6. **Main Flow / Functional Steps**:
	* Load data from "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" tables into the Silver layer.
	* Join the two tables on the "id" column.
	* Remove records with Null values.
	* Remove duplicate records.
	* Apply SCD type 2 logic using "id" as the primary key.
	* Create columns such as CreateDateTime, UpdateDateTime, and IsActive flag.
	* Update UpdateDateTime and IsActive flag when new data arrives.
7. **Alternate Flows / Exceptions**:
	* If data loading fails, log an error and notify the Data Engineering Team.
	* If data cleansing fails, log an error and notify the Data Engineering Team.
8. **Postconditions / Outputs**: Cleaned and transformed data is loaded into the Silver layer table "customer_order_combined".
9. **Business Rules**:
	* Use SCD type 2 to keep history.
	* Use watermark columns to track data changes.
10. **Data Requirements**:
	* Input: Data from "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" tables.
	* Output: Loaded data in "customer_order_combined" table.
11. **Assumptions**: Unity Catalog is properly configured and accessible.
12. **Dependencies**: Unity Catalog, Delta Live Tables (DLT) syntax.
13. **Priority**: High
14. **Acceptance Criteria**:
	* Data is correctly loaded into "customer_order_combined" table.
	* Data is correctly cleansed and transformed.

**FR-ETL-003: Load Data to Gold Layer**

1. **Title**: Load Data to Gold Layer
2. **Description**: The system must load data from Silver layer table "customer_order_combined" into the Gold layer using DLT syntax and Auto Loader, applying aggregation and curation logic.
3. **Actor(s)**: Data Engineering Team, Unity Catalog
4. **Preconditions**: 
	* Data is loaded into "customer_order_combined" table.
	* Unity Catalog is properly configured.
5. **Trigger**: Manual trigger or scheduled trigger to initiate the data load process.
6. **Main Flow / Functional Steps**:
	* Load data from "customer_order_combined" table into the Gold layer.
	* Group data by "age" or "email domain".
	* Aggregate metrics such as Total revenue and Average order amount.
	* Create columns such as CreateDateTime, UpdateDateTime, and IsActive flag.
	* Update UpdateDateTime and IsActive flag when new data arrives.
7. **Alternate Flows / Exceptions**:
	* If data loading fails, log an error and notify the Data Engineering Team.
	* If aggregation or curation fails, log an error and notify the Data Engineering Team.
8. **Postconditions / Outputs**: Aggregated and curated data is loaded into the Gold layer table "customer_order_summary".
9. **Business Rules**:
	* Use SCD type 2 to keep history.
	* Use watermark columns to track data changes.
10. **Data Requirements**:
	* Input: Data from "customer_order_combined" table.
	* Output: Loaded data in "customer_order_summary" table.
11. **Assumptions**: Unity Catalog is properly configured and accessible.
