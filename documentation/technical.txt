Here is the Technical Requirement Document (TRD) based on the provided Functional Requirement Document (FRD):

* Technical Requirement ID: TR-ORD-001
* Related Functional Requirement(s): FR-ORD-001
* Objective: Implement a PySpark job to read customer and order data from CSV files, clean and process the data, and load it into a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 table called "ordersummary".

* Target Cluster Configuration:
  * Cluster Name: Databricks Cluster for Data Ingestion
  * Databricks Runtime Version: 10.4 LTS
  * Node Type: Standard_DS3_v2
  * Driver Node: Standard_DS3_v2
  * Worker Nodes: 2-4 nodes, depending on data volume
  * Autoscaling: Enabled
  * Auto Termination: 30 minutes
  * Libraries Installed: 
    * PySpark
    * Delta Lake

* Source Data Details:
  * Customer Data: 
    * Dataset Name: customerdata
    * Location (Path/Table): /Volumes/gen_ai_poc_databrickscoe/sdlc_wizard/customerdata
    * Format: CSV
    * Description: Customer information
  * Order Data: 
    * Dataset Name: orderdata
    * Location (Path/Table): /Volumes/gen_ai_poc_databrickscoe/sdlc_wizard/orderdata
    * Format: CSV
    * Description: Order information

* Target Data Details:
  * Output Name: ordersummary
  * Location: gen_ai_poc_databrickscoe.sdlc_wizard.ordersummary
  * Format: Delta Lake
  * Description: Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 table containing customer and order data

* Job Flow / Pipeline Stages:
  * Read customer data from CSV file
  * Read order data from CSV file
  * Load customer data into a delta table
  * Load order data into a delta table
  * Remove "Null"/Null and duplicate records from both customer and order tables
  * Create the "ordersummary" table if it does not exist
  * Join customer and order data using the "CustId" field
  * Load the joined data into the "ordersummary" SCD Type 2 table
  * Update the "ordersummary" table with new records

* Data Transformations / Business Logic:
  * Step: Remove "Null"/Null and duplicate records
    * Description: Clean customer and order data
    * Transformation Logic: Use PySpark to filter out null records and drop duplicates
  * Step: Join customer and order data
    * Description: Join customer and order data using CustId
    * Transformation Logic: Use PySpark to join customer and order data on CustId
  * Step: Update SCD Type 2 table
    * Description: Update "ordersummary" table with new records
    * Transformation Logic: Use Delta Lake to implement SCD Type 2 logic, updating StartDate, EndDate, and IsActive columns

* Error Handling and Logging:
  * Log errors and exceptions to a designated log file
  * Handle null and duplicate records by removing them from the dataset
  * Implement retry mechanism for failed jobs due to transient errors
