## Technical Requirement Document (TRD) - End-to-End ETL Pipeline for Product Data

**Step 1: Load Raw Data to Bronze Layer**

*   **Technical Requirement ID:** TR-BRZ-001
*   **Related Functional Requirement(s):** FR-BRZ-001
*   **Objective:** Implement a Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipeline to ingest customer data from a CSV file in a Unity Catalog Volume into a Delta table in the Bronze layer, applying SCD type-2 logic, history tracking, watermark columns, and activity flags.
*   **Target Cluster Configuration:**
    *   Cluster Name: etl-dlt-cluster
    *   Databricks Runtime Version: 14.3.x-photon-scala2.12
    *   Node Type: Standard_DS3_v2
    *   Driver Node: 1
    *   Worker Nodes: 2 (minimum), Autoscaling enabled
    *   Autoscaling: Enabled, min workers: 2, max workers: 4
    *   Auto Termination: 120 minutes inactivity
    *   Libraries Installed: None specified, assuming DLT handles dependencies. If specific libraries are needed, they will be added (e.g., `delta-spark` if not included in the runtime).
*   **Source Data Details:**
    *   Dataset Name: Customer Data
    *   Location (Path/Table): `/Volumes/catalog_sdlc/rawdata/customer`
    *   Format: CSV
    *   Description: Contains raw customer data including id, name, email, and age.
*   **Target Data Details:**
    *   Output Name: customer_raw
    *   Location: `bronzezone.data.customer_raw`
    *   Format: Delta
    *   Description: Delta table containing customer data from CSV, with SCD type-2 history, `CreateDateTime`, `UpdateDateTime`, and `IsActive` columns.
*   **Job Flow / Pipeline Stages:**
    1.  Check if catalog "bronzezone" exists, create if not.
    2.  Check if schema "data" exists in "bronzezone", create if not.
    3.  Check if table "customer_raw" exists in "bronzezone.data", create if not.
    4.  Use Auto Loader to read CSV data from `/Volumes/catalog_sdlc/rawdata/customer`.
    5.  Infer CSV schema (or use predefined schema).
    6.  Add columns: `CreateDateTime`, `UpdateDateTime`, `IsActive`.
    7.  Apply SCD Type 2 logic to `bronzezone.data.customer_raw` using `id` as the key.
    8.  Use watermark columns for change tracking.
*   **Data Transformations / Business Logic:**
    *   Step 1: Ingest Raw Data
        *   Description: Load data from CSV using Auto Loader.
        *   Transformation Logic: `spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles").option("cloudFiles.format", "csv").option("header", "true").load("/Volumes/catalog_sdlc/rawdata/customer")`
    *   Step 2: Apply SCD Type 2
        *   Description: Implement SCD Type 2 logic based on the `id` column.
        *   Transformation Logic:  Use MERGE INTO statement or custom SCD Type 2 logic with `CreateDateTime`, `UpdateDateTime`, and `IsActive` columns.  When a matching `id` is found and the data has changed, update the existing record by setting `IsActive = false` and `UpdateDateTime = now()` and insert the new record with `IsActive = true` and `CreateDateTime = now()`. If no matching `id` is found, insert the new record with `IsActive = true`, `CreateDateTime = now()`, and `UpdateDateTime = now()`.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Implement error handling to capture exceptions during data ingestion and transformation.
    *   Log errors to Databricks logs with relevant details (e.g., filename, error message, timestamp).
    *   Handle invalid data (e.g., incorrect data types) by either skipping the record or logging it to a separate error table.
    *   If the Unity Catalog Volume is inaccessible or the CSV file is not found, log an error and fail the pipeline.
    *   Configure DLT expectations to validate data quality and handle schema evolution.
*   **Scheduling & Triggering:**
    *   The DLT pipeline will be triggered manually or on a schedule (e.g., daily).
    *   Configure the DLT pipeline to automatically trigger when new data arrives in the Unity Catalog Volume.
*   **Security & Access Control:**
    *   The Data Engineering Team requires appropriate privileges to read from the Unity Catalog Volume and write to the `bronzezone.data.customer_raw` Delta table.
    *   Secure access credentials to the Unity Catalog Volume.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Unity Catalog
    *   Delta Live Tables
    *   Auto Loader
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The CSV file is properly formatted and adheres to the expected schema.
    *   The Unity Catalog Volume is correctly configured and accessible.
    *   The Data Engineering Team has the proper privileges to create and write to the Unity Catalog Volume.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The DLT pipeline successfully ingests customer data from the CSV file into the `bronzezone.data.customer_raw` table.
    *   The table schema matches the expected schema (including the added columns).
    *   SCD type-2 logic is correctly implemented with the `id` as the primary key.
    *   `CreateDateTime`, `UpdateDateTime`, and `IsActive` columns are populated correctly.
    *   The pipeline handles errors gracefully and logs appropriate messages.
    *   Watermark columns are used.
*   **Notes / Implementation Suggestions:**
    *   Consider using a configuration table to store the path to the CSV file and other parameters.
    *   Implement data quality checks using DLT expectations to ensure data accuracy.
    *   For initial load, all records will be inserted as new records.

    *   Auto Termination: 120 minutes inactivity
    *   Libraries Installed: None specified, assuming DLT handles dependencies. If specific libraries are needed, they will be added (e.g., `delta-spark` if not included in the runtime).
*   **Source Data Details:**
    *   Dataset Name: Combined Customer Order Data
    *   Location (Path/Table): `silverzone.data.customer_order_combined`
    *   Format: Delta

    5.  Group the data by either `age` or `email domain` (configurable).
    6.  Calculate aggregate metrics (total revenue, average order amount).
    7.  Add columns: `CreateDateTime`, `UpdateDateTime`, `IsActive`.
    8.  Apply SCD Type 2 logic to `goldzone.data.customer_order_summary` using the grouping key (age or email domain) as the key.

        *   Transformation Logic:  Use MERGE INTO statement or custom SCD Type 2 logic with `CreateDateTime`, `UpdateDateTime`, and `IsActive` columns.  When a matching grouping key is found and the aggregate metrics have changed, update the existing record by setting `IsActive = false` and `UpdateDateTime = now()` and insert the new record with `IsActive = true` and `CreateDateTime = now()`. If no matching grouping key is found, insert the new record with `IsActive = true`, `CreateDateTime = now()`, and `UpdateDateTime = now()`.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Implement error handling to capture exceptions during data ingestion, transformation, aggregation, and SCD Type 2 application.

    *   If the source table does not exist, log an error and fail the pipeline.
    *   If the aggregation operation fails, log an error and fail the pipeline.
    *   If there is an issue applying SCD type-2 logic, log an error and fail the pipeline.
    *   Configure DLT expectations to validate data quality.
*   **Scheduling & Triggering:**
    *   The DLT pipeline will be triggered manually or on a schedule (e.g., daily).
    *   Configure the DLT pipeline to automatically trigger when the Silver layer table is updated.
*   **Security & Access Control:**
    *   The Data Engineering Team requires appropriate privileges to read from the `silverzone.data.customer_order_combined` table and write to the `goldzone.data.customer_order_summary` Delta table.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Unity Catalog
    *   Delta Live Tables
    *   `silverzone.data.customer_order_combined`
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The aggregation operation is successful.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The DLT pipeline successfully aggregates the data from the Silver layer and loads it into `goldzone.data.customer_order_summary`.

    *   SCD type-2 logic is correctly implemented with the grouping key as the primary key.
    *   Aggregate metrics are calculated correctly.
    *   `CreateDateTime`, `UpdateDateTime`, and `IsActive` columns are populated correctly.

    *   Consider window functions for future enhancements (e.g., historical comparisons).
