Here is the Technical Requirement Document (TRD) based on the provided Functional Requirement Document (FRD):

**TR-ETL-001: Load Raw Data to Bronze Layer**

1. **Technical Requirement ID**: TR-ETL-001
2. **Related Functional Requirement(s)**: FR-ETL-001
3. **Objective**: Implement a PySpark job to load raw Customer and Order data from Unity Catalog volumes into the Bronze layer, creating the "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" tables with SCD type-2, keeping history, and using watermark columns.
4. **Target Cluster Configuration**:
	* Cluster Name: ETL-Cluster
	* Databricks Runtime Version: 10.4
	* Node Type: Standard_DS3_v2
	* Driver Node: Standard_DS3_v2
	* Worker Nodes: 2x Standard_DS3_v2
	* Autoscaling: Enabled
	* Auto Termination: 30 minutes
	* Libraries Installed: delta, spark-csv
5. **Source Data Details**:
	* Dataset Name: Customer Raw Data
	* Location (Path/Table): Unity Catalog volume
	* Format: CSV
	* Description: Raw Customer data from Unity Catalog volume
	* Dataset Name: Order Raw Data
	* Location (Path/Table): Unity Catalog volume
	* Format: CSV
	* Description: Raw Order data from Unity Catalog volume
6. **Target Data Details**:
	* Output Name: customer_raw
	* Location: Bronze layer
	* Format: Delta
	* Description: Raw Customer data loaded into the Bronze layer
	* Output Name: orders_raw
	* Location: Bronze layer
	* Format: Delta
	* Description: Raw Order data loaded into the Bronze layer
7. **Job Flow / Pipeline Stages**:
	* Stage 1: Create the "bronzezone" catalog, "data" schema, and "customer_raw" table if they do not exist.
	* Stage 2: Ingest raw Customer data from Unity Catalog volume using delta live table syntax and Auto Loader (cloud_files with format="csv").
	* Stage 3: Load raw Order data from Unity Catalog volume using delta live table syntax and Auto Loader (cloud_files with format="csv").
	* Stage 4: Create the "orders_raw" table with SCD type-2, keeping history, and using watermark columns.
8. **Data Transformations / Business Logic**:
	* Step 1: Apply SCD type-2 logic to the "customer_raw" table.
		+ Transformation Logic: Use the "id" column to apply SCD type-2 logic.
	* Step 2: Apply SCD type-2 logic to the "orders_raw" table.
		+ Transformation Logic: Use the "id" column to apply SCD type-2 logic.
9. **Error Handling and Logging**:
	* Log errors to a designated error log table.
	* Notify the Data Engineering Team via email in case of errors.
10. **Scheduling & Triggering**:
	* Trigger the job manually using the Databricks UI.
11. **Security & Access Control**:
	* Use Unity Catalog authentication to access the Unity Catalog volumes.
	* Grant the Data Engineering Team permission to read and write to the Bronze layer.
12. **Dependencies**:
	* Unity Catalog volumes are accessible.
	* Databricks cluster is available.
13. **Assumptions**:
	* Unity Catalog volumes are properly configured.
14. **Acceptance Criteria**:
	* Raw Customer and Order data are correctly loaded into the Bronze layer.
	* "customer_raw" and "orders_raw" tables are created with SCD type-2, keeping history, and using watermark columns.
15. **Notes / Implementation Suggestions**:
	* Consider using a more efficient data ingestion method, such as using a Databricks Auto Loader with a JSON format.
